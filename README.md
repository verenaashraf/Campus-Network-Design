🔐 Real-World Network Challenges? We Faced Them – and Solved Them! 🌐✨

I’m incredibly proud to share our Campus Network Design Project completed .
This wasn’t just a network setup — it was a deep dive into real-world problems and how to secure and improve a campus network .

💥 What we faced:
🔸 No VLANs – All departments shared the same broadcast domain.
🔸 Single path communication – One router down? Entire segments lost.
🔸 No load balancing – Traffic congestion and poor performance.
🔸 DHCP attacks, MAC flooding, SSH brute force threats… and more.

🛡️ What we implemented:
✔️ DHCP Snooping – to block rogue DHCP servers and detect starvation attacks
✔️ Port Security – to prevent MAC flooding attacks
✔️ AAA (Local, RADIUS, TACACS+) – for access control & secure authentication
✔️ Syslog Server – for centralized event tracking
✔️ ACLs – to block IP spoofing, invalid ranges, and multicast attacks
✔️ SSH Hardening – to resist brute-force login attempts
✔️ Dynamic (OSPF) + Static Routing – for scalability with stability
✔️ Essential Services – HTTP (student portal), Mail, DNS, FTP, NTP

💡 What this project taught me:

How to analyze and break down complex network weaknesses

How to design efficient, secure solutions with limited resources

Deep technical knowledge of Layer 2/3, security threats, and server integration

That engineering isn’t just about building—it’s about fixing, protecting, and thinking ahead.

This project boosted my skills in network security, infrastructure design, and critical thinking. I can't wait to take this knowledge into real-world challenges!
